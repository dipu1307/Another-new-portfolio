Afridi was also a world record holder, holding the record for the fastest ODI century, in 37 deliveries. The record stood for 17 years before being broken by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Anderson_(cricketer)" target="_blank">Corey Anderson.</a> He also holds the record for having hit the most sixes in the history of ODI cricket.

            <h4>Batting</h4>
            <p>His general style of batting is very aggressive and attack oriented. Due to this reason, Indian cricketer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri" target="_blank">Ravi Shastri</a> gave him the nickname <strong>"Boom Boom"</strong>. Moreover, out of the seven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_One_Day_International_cricket_records#Fastest_centuries" target="_blank"><strong>fastest ODI centuries</strong></a> of all time, Afridi has produced three of them. Throughout his career, he had an ODI strike rate of 117 runs per 100 ball, the third highest in the game's history. This attitude has been transferred to Test cricket as well, with Afridi scoring at a relatively high strike rate of 86.97.</p>
            <p>He is known for hitting long sixes, while his trademark shot is a cross-batted flick to the leg-side to a ball outside off stump. However, his aggressive style increases his risk of getting out and he is one of the most inconsistent batsmen in cricket.</p>

            <h4>Bowling</h4>
            <p>Having started as a fast bowler, Afridi decided to start bowling spin after he was told he was throwing. He modelled
            himself on Pakistan leg-spinner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadir_(cricketer)" target="_blank">Adbul Qadir.</a> Afridi began his career as primarily a bowler, but after scoring the fastest century in his maiden ODI innings more was
            expected of him with the bat. In 2011, he said, "I consider myself a bowler first". He took 541 International <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket" target="_blank">wickets</a> in his career, most of which were from the ODI format. While his stock ball is the <strong>leg break,</strong> his armoury also includes <strong>the googly</strong> and a <strong><i>"quicker one"</i></strong> which he can deliver in the style of a medium-pacer, reaching speeds of around 130 km/h (81 mph).</p>
            <p>On 23 August 2018, after a match winning all-round performance in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Premier_League" target="_blank"> Caribbean Premier League</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados_Royals" target="_blank">Barbados Tridents</a>, Australian crickter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)" target="_blank">Steve Smith</a> said that he tried to model the bowling action of Afridi. He praised Afridi, calling him "a terrific leg-spinner".</p>
