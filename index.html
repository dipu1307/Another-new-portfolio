            <h4>Batting</h4>
            <p>His general style of batting is very aggressive and attack oriented. Due to this reason, Indian cricketer <a href="#" target="_blank">Ravi Shastri</a> gave him the nickname <strong>"Boom Boom"</strong>. Moreover, out of the seven <a href="#" target="_blank"><strong>fastest ODI centuries</strong></a> of all time, Afridi has produced three of them. Throughout his career, he had an ODI strike rate of 117 runs per 100 ball, the third highest in the game's history. This attitude has been transferred to Test cricket as well, with Afridi scoring at a relatively high strike rate of 86.97.</p>
            <p>He is known for hitting long sixes, while his trademark shot is a cross-batted flick to the leg-side to a ball outside off stump. However, his aggressive style increases his risk of getting out and he is one of the most inconsistent batsmen in cricket.</p>
