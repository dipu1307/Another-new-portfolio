            <h4>Batting</h4>
            <p>His general style of batting is very aggressive and attack oriented. Due to this reason, Indian cricketer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shastri" target="_blank">Ravi Shastri</a> gave him the nickname <strong>"Boom Boom"</strong>. Moreover, out of the seven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_One_Day_International_cricket_records#Fastest_centuries" target="_blank"><strong>fastest ODI centuries</strong></a> of all time, Afridi has produced three of them. Throughout his career, he had an ODI strike rate of 117 runs per 100 ball, the third highest in the game's history. This attitude has been transferred to Test cricket as well, with Afridi scoring at a relatively high strike rate of 86.97.</p>
            <p>He is known for hitting long sixes, while his trademark shot is a cross-batted flick to the leg-side to a ball outside off stump. However, his aggressive style increases his risk of getting out and he is one of the most inconsistent batsmen in cricket.</p>

            <h4>Bowling</h4>
            <p>Having started as a fast bowler, Afridi decided to start bowling spin after he was told he was throwing. He modelled
            himself on Pakistan leg-spinner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadir_(cricketer)" target="_blank">Adbul Qadir.</a> Afridi began his career as primarily a bowler, but after scoring the fastest century in his maiden ODI innings more was
            expected of him with the bat. In 2011, he said, "I consider myself a bowler first". He took 541 International <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket" target="_blank">wickets</a> in his career, most of which were from the ODI format. While his stock ball is the <strong>leg break,</strong> his armoury also includes <strong>the googly</strong> and a <strong><i>"quicker one"</i></strong> which he can deliver in the style of a medium-pacer, reaching speeds of around 130 km/h (81 mph).</p>
            <p>On 23 August 2018, after a match winning all-round performance in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Premier_League" target="_blank"> Caribbean Premier League</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados_Royals" target="_blank">Barbados Tridents</a>, Australian crickter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)" target="_blank">Steve Smith</a> said that he tried to model the bowling action of Afridi. He praised Afridi, calling him "a terrific leg-spinner".</p>

            <h4>International career</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>In October 1996, Afridi was drafted into the ODI team during the four-nation Sameer Cup 1996-97 as a leg spinner as a
            replacement for the injured Mushtaq Ahmed. He made his debut on 2 October against Kenya; however, he didn't bat and went wicketless. In the next match against Sri Lanka, Afridi batted at number three in the role of a pinch-hitter. In his first
            international innings, Afridi broke the record for fastest century in ODI cricket, reaching his hundred from 37 balls.
            The eleven sixes he struck also equaled the record for most in an ODI innings. Pakistan posted a total of 371, at the time the second-highest in ODIs, and won by 82 runs; Afridi was named man of the
            match. The record for fastest century in ODI was broken by New Zealand cricketer Corey Anderson on 1 January 2014 who reached
            triple-figures from 36 balls and is now held by South-African cricketer AB de Villiers who made a century from 31 balls
            on 18 January 2015 against West Indies.</p>

                <h1>Captaincy Career Of Afridi</h1>
                <h4>Captaincy (2009-2011)</h4>
                <p>Shortly after Pakistan won the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 the captain Younis Khan announced his retirement from Twenty20
                cricket the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) subsequently announced that Shahid Afridi had taken over as captain in T20Is;
                the appointment was initially for one match, with a decision on the permanent replacement to be made later. On 25 May 2010, Afridi was appointed captain of the national team in all three formats, after he announced his return to
                Test cricket. In July 2010, Afridi captained Pakistan in the first Test of the series at Lord's against Australia. He scored 31 off 15
                deliveries in the first innings and 2 in the second but was dismissed succumbing to rash strokes in both the innings.
                After the match, he announced retirement from Test cricket again citing lack of temperament for Test cricket as the
                reason. Afridi was officially removed from the Test squad on the England tour, but after the spot-fixing scandal saw Mohammad
                Asif, Mohammad Amir and Test captain Salman Butt temporarily suspended by the International Cricket Council, he stated
                that he might return to Test cricket if "the team needs it". According to a representative of Afridi, he had voiced his concerns about Mazhar Majeed - who had approached Pakistan's
                players - in June.</p>

                <h1>Internation T20 Career</h1>
                <h4>2016 ICC World T20</h4>
                <p>In March 2016, Pakistan was unable to make it to the semi-finals in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after losing to New
                Zealand, India and Australia. Before Australia's match, the PCB hinted at Afridi's retirement. However, he went against
                their decision after the match and announced that he would make the decision himself after consulting family and other
                iconic players beforehand and also announce it in Pakistan. He also stated that 'as a player, I am fit. As a captain, I am not fit'.[120] Former Australian player Ian Chappell
                praised his honesty in this confession. Waqar Younis, the head coach, was initially blamed and he accepted responsibility and offered to retire. However, a
                six-page report by Younis was later leaked by the PCB to the media where he was shown to be pointing much of the blame
                onto Afridi. First Younis claimed that Afridi was 'unfair' to new cricketer Mohammad Nawaz by calling him up to bowl in
                the Asia Cup 2016 because it 'destroyed the youngster's confidence' after he gave 38-runs in 3 overs. Younis went on to
                accuse Afridi of being 'non-serious' in the game along with saying that he missed training sessions and meetings. He
                also said that Afridi showed poor performance with the bat, ball and as a captain and was clearly not listened to by
                other players.</p>
